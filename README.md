## 2048 with React, Jest & Cypress
[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ssihvola/2048)

Created a clone of the game 2048 using React. Unit tests were done with Jest and, to complement those, E2E tests with Cypress. I also conducted a usability testing situation with an external participant during the early stages of development. This gave me non-author biased information early on, which was very helpful!

## Swag Labs with Robot Framework
[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ssihvola/swaglabs-with-robotframework)

Tested a dummy e-commerce store with Robot Framework. Each of the dummy accounts available represented a test suite. As expected, all of the failures were concentrated around the same accounts.

## Samposihvola.com with HTML, CSS & Robot Framework
[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ssihvola/ssihvola.github.io)

Created my personal website with HTML & CSS. Site has links to various external websites such as YouTube, so I also created tests with Robot Framework to check that all the content is still online. There's also a contact form which is covered as well in the automated tests.
